# eigen-entropy-tss
Full implementation of the Eigen-entropy based Time Series Signatures algorithm (EE - TSS).  The technique "achieves high recall rates with limited clinical datasets but also ensures the algorithm's feature generation is understandable, addressing a critical need for clinician-friendly tools."

The algorithm is coded in Python with Joblib parallel processing.  The binary classification dataset heartbeat is used to illustrate the algorithm.  The classes are 0=Normal and 1=Abnormal.  We want to catch all abnormal heartbeats so a recall is the key metric.

* For the original heartbeat data, a Ridge Classifier returns Recall = 98.64%
* EE - TSS transformed data and Ridge Classifier achieves Recall = 100%
